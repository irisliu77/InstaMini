# InstaMini
This is a web application that imitates the user behavior that we can have in Instagram.

User can do several different kinds of action like post, update, like, delete, and follow.

There is also a client management system for those administrator who doesn't know how to code to manage the app.

Python Django framework is mainly what I used for this app.

HTML, CSS, SQL are also used in this project.
